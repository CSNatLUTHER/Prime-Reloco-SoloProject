## Description

Making a move can feel overwhelming as you consider the process of getting your possessions organized and to their final destination. Major decisions like what items to donate, purge, store or ship can be difficult, and tracking those decisions is challenging. This application is designed to be an aide to users in tracking all their belongings at an item, box and location level. 

Each independent item and box will have a unique QR code that will allow the user to provide key details and decisions about an item/box, associate items to a box, and make a final decision to whether the item/box will be shipped, stored, donated or purged. 

Upon launching the application, a visitor will be allowed to register and create a moving event. They’ll also be able to invite other’s to a moving event as they collaborate on a move with individuals in their household. 

Finally, as a user begins documenting their possessions, a report can be viewed and downloaded from the 'manage event screen' at any time.

## Getting Started

Be sure to check out the readme and database.sql files for more instructions and database requirements. 

### Prerequisites

To properly host this application, NPM, nodemon, brew and Postico should be installed and available. 

### Installation

A full list of requirements can be found in the dependencies section of the package.json file.

See readme and package.json for more details. 

## Usage

This application does not natively include the QR moving tags for the items and boxes. It is designed to accept an QR text code as identifier allowing the user to make use of their own QR tables (including designing their own) 

The label company Avery does allow you to design and serialize QR codes and labels. You can then self-print or have them print them for you. 

You can also contact us through the site for more options. reloco.herokuapp.com/contact.
